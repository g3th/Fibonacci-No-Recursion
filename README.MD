## C++ Fibonacci Sequence (Transforming and Returning values)
### Using Reference Declaration or just a function

Simple program which output a Fibonacci sequence without recursion, using just a void function or a function which transforms the original values.

The 'void fibonacci' function just outputs the sequence up to the give range, by using three separate variables with a similar method to the 'fibonacci swap' function.

The other method takes user input, takes the reference of two values (n1, n2)  and their sum, transforms the values ~~and returns the new values~~ until the loop is completed (values don't need to be returned since the value is changed in the memory address where the variable resides).

The user chooses the length of the loop, by indicating how many numbers the Fibonacci sequence should run for.

This is one of the ways to code this sequence without using direct recursion.
