## C++ Fibonacci Sequence (Transforming and Returning values)
### Using Reference Declaration

Simple program which takes user input, takes the reference of two values (n1, n2)  and their sum, transforms the values and returns the new values until the loop is completed.

The user chooses the length of the loop, by indicating how many numbers the Fibonacci sequence should run for.

This is one of the ways to code this sequence without using direct recursion.
